\section{Limitations and Future Work}

A key limitation is the lack of detailed analysis on why iterative composition strategies show limited effectiveness with smaller models. While our experiments show minimal improvements from complex iterative methods, we have not thoroughly explored specific cognitive deficiencies such as reasoning depth or instruction-following capabilities.

Moreover, our adaptive heuristics rely on indirect measures like answer consistency rather than direct meta-cognitive evaluation. Current models lack intrinsic meta-cognitive abilities, unlike humans who intuitively assess uncertainty and the need for further reasoning.

Future research should systematically investigate cognitive bottlenecks in smaller models and explore methods to enhance model introspection. Additionally, integrating adaptive compositional strategies within meta-learning frameworks could further optimize strategy selection and efficiency.
